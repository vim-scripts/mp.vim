This is identation file for MetaPost language. I'm not write same file for MetaFont only because I not use this powerfull program, but it is very similar to MetaPost language and if somebody ask me to write it I may be do this.

So this is citation from mp.vim where I wrote about indent in MetaPost

" Identation Rules: {{{1 
" First of all, MetaPost language don't expect any identation rules.
" This screept need for you only if you (not MetaPost) need to do
" exactly code. If you don't need to use indentation, see
" :help filetype-indent-off
"
" Note: Every rules of identation in MetaPost or TeX languages (and in some
" other of course) is very subjective. I can release only my vision of this
" promlem.
